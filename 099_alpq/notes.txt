HW99 -- Some Are More Equal Than Others, Codified

time spent: 0.9hrs

DISCO:
 - Removing from the end of an ArrayList is a constant time operation
 - Although binary search has been implemented in our add() method, the method still
   runs in O(n) time, because it must before an ArrayList.add() operation, which runs
   in O(n) time, overriding the O(log n) time complexity that binary search has
 - isEmpty(), peekMin(), and removeMin() a trivial to implement.

QCC:
 - How exactly does an ArrayPriorityQueue differ from an OrderedArrayList? It's
   functionality and use cases appear to be the same.
 - How much does it matter whether the ArrayList used as the datatype is sorted from
   low to high or high to low?
 - It's kind of crazy that the seemingly logarithmic nature of the add() method is
   overruled by it having a single linear-time operation inside!

HW97 -- Prune Your Tree
2022-05-11
time spent: 1.3hrs

DISCO:
 - There's four cases for removing a node:
    -> The node we're trying to remove has BOTH a left AND right connection
    -> The node we're trying to remove has ONLY a left connection
    -> The node we're trying to remove has ONLY a right connection
    -> The node we're trying to remove has NO connections (it's alif node)
 - Inside of each of the four cases, we have to account for if the current
   node is a root, and if the current node is to the left or right of parent
 - Nodes can be removed iteratively, rather than recursively (as the other
   methods we've written for BSTs have been)

QCC:
 - Can we make our remove() function have less repetitive code?
 - What's the time complexity of the remove() function?

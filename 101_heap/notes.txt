APCS HW101 -- Heap o'Trouble 
2022-05-16 
time spent: 0.5hrs

DISCO:
- We created an algo similar to bubble sort in the sense that we swap two nodes if the heap property isn't met.
- When removing a node, you should nominate the rightmost node to replace it.
- Similarly, when inserting a node, we first place it at the rightmost position.

QCC:
- What are heaps used for?
- What happens if multiple of same element?
- Would insert/remove in max heap be similar?

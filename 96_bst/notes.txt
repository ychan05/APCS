HW96 -- BSTs is the Perfect Place for Shade

time spent: 

DISCO:
 - All the recursive methods we wrote ended up requiring helper methods which were not
   included in the skeleton
 - All of the methods we wrote involve only three different parts of the tree: the
   current node, the left branch, and the right branch
 - All of the methods we wrote followed a similar format -- having a recursive case
   and a base case, both of which could be expressed concisely. Also, all three
   methods had a "null" base case, but the way we wrote numLeavesHelper() included
   a secondary base case for leaf nodes

QCC:
 - What other methods would be appropriate to add to binary search trees?
 - Can the methods that we wrote be expressed through code that runs iteratively
   rather than recursively?
 - For numLeavesHelper(), is it possible to write the function with only one base case
   instead of two base cases (one handling null cases and one handling leaf nodes)?

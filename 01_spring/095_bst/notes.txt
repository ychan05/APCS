DISCO
- If a node we are trying to insert is already in the tree, we don't add it.
- The different methods of traversal are the same 3 steps rearranged in different orders.

QCC
- Would the time complexity of the insert method be O( log(n) )?
- Does L refer to the count of levels or the level index of a specific layer?

L = level, d = depth, h = height

1. a perfect binary tree has 2^L - 1 nodes
2. at each level, a perfect binary tree has 2^d nodes
3. height of a complete binary tree w/ n nodes is Ceiling( log_2(n + 1) ) - 1

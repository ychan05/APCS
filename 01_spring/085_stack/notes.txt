time spent: 0.6hrs

DISCO:
 - a size instance variable isn't needed b/c size is already tracked inside the LL or AL
 - peekTop() can return a value directly stored in the list (at position _stackSize-1).


QCC:
 - Does Z refer to a generic type that we set ourselves?
 - Can an object take several generic types (ex <Integer, String>)?

HW90 - Swabbing the Deque
2022-04-12T
time spent: 0.4 hours


DISCO
- Using LinkedList in a Deque implementation would be best because it is
  doubly linked and has O(1) add/remove at either end
- LinkedList has most of the methods needed for a deque.
- We simply limited List fxnality from LList in the LLDeque class.


QCC
- Are we supposed to make the class using nodes or can we just make a wrapper class?
- The Deque interface normally has two versions of each method, one that
  throws an exception and one that doesn't. Should we implement both?

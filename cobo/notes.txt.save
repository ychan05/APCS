   and a "Celebrity" class, which will store the name and information for a celebrity

2. The list of celebrities, a score, and the chosen celebrity that you have to guess

3. initialize() -- initialize the game
   scorePoint() -- increment score by one

       i. Take a random celebrity from the list (don't replace)
      ii. Set guess count to 0

           i.

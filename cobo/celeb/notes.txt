ACTIVITY 1

1. We would include a "Game" class, which will store the current game information,
   and a "Celebrity" class, which will store the name and information for a celebrity

2. The list of celebrities, a score, and the chosen celebrity that you have to guess

3. initialize() -- initialize the game
   scorePoint() -- increment score by one
   discard()    -- take the top celebrity off the deck

4. We will make the behaviors from question 3 into methods

5. ALGO:   
   1. Do the following until the list of celebrities is empty:
       i. Take a random celebrity from the list (don't replace)
      ii. Set guess count to 0
     iii. Display hint
      iv. Do the following until guess count = 5, or isCorrect() yields true
           i. Prompt the player to enter a celebrity
          ii. Increase guess count by 1

   (We're aware that this doesn't work with the time thing. We will concern ourselves
    with that later).

6. Object: A rock
   Associated information:
    - measure of hardness
    - type of rock
    - age
   Behaviors:
    - throw
    - lift
    - swallow

7. n/a -- done




ACTIVITY 2

1. To initialize instance variables, and other properties of the class instance

2. public <CLASSNAME>(<ARGS>)

3. String _name, String _clue

4. getName() <- could also be the toString() method
   getClue()
   setName(String newName)
   setClue(String newClue)
   isCorrect(String checkName)
   
7. The second constructor takes in no arguments, and sets the answer and clue to default values




ACTIVITY 3

1. We looked at the JComponent class, which has the following handling events, among others:
     addHierarchyListener(), addMouseListener(), addMouseMotionListener(), addKeyListener()
   This component appears to respond to mouse movement and keystrokes

2. private ArrayList<Celebrity> celebGameList;

3. It's visibility should also be private, because it will be accessed via accessor methods

12. celebrityGame

13. nothing



ACTIVITY 4 

1. 
   Class Name: sportsCeleb

   Atributes: String name,
